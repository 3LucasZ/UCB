This is mostly true, but there is often an art that comes to both techniques. In many cases, you can exploit symmetries or be clever in other ways. We already did this with the 5-card flush probability: a more naive way would have been to iterate over all $52 \\cdot 51 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 48$ ways 5-cards could be dealt. Most \"tricks\" aren't as obvious, but when found, they can greatly speed up your program.\n",

For 5-card hands, A K K 5 A is symmetrical since it can be arranged into A K 5 K A, whereas 10 10 J Q 10 isn't symmetrical. To find this probability, we could take a similar approach to the flush program, but that would involve going through 206379406870 hands. This isn't feasible, but it turns out some hands are the same, since in this problem, the suit doesn't matter. A hand is really just a tuple with the counts of each rank. For example 10 10 J Q 10 is\n",
