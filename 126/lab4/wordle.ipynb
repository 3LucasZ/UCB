Take a look at the example below.\n",

In other words, we can think of each guess as \"narrowing down\" the alphabet of $X$.\n",

We want to minimize the conditional entropy $H(X_t|Y_{t,k})$ over $k \\in$ `allowed_guesses` since it's the \"leftover uncertainty\" about $X_t$ after observing the color pattern for $k$.

However, if we know $X_t$ (which means we peek at the answer), then $Y_{t,k}|X_t$ is deterministic!

    "## Some Useful Optimizations (Read Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "This part has no implementation that you need to do, but it's highly recommended that you read through this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation to find \"soare\" took a while to run, didn't it? You may realize that the opening guess is always made without any observed pattern, so we don't need to calculate it every time, but can instead save the result that if it's our first guess, we would always return \"soare\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing is that now our guesses always come from the huge list of allowed guesses. Suppose that we have now narrowed the alphabet of $X_t$ down to 2 words, \"price\" and \"pride\". Guessing a word that isn't in the alphabet, such as \"camel\", will certainly tell us which one is the correct answer (since it tells us whether there is a \"c\" in the answer), but we will still need to use a guess to report the correct answer, for a total of 2 additional guesses. However, if we guess a word in the alphabet, not only will it tell us which one of \"price\" and \"pride\" is the answer, but also we have a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability to hit it right there so we don't need another guess. Therefore, when the remaining alphabet is small ($\\leq 3$), we can instead limit our guesses to within the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following function implements these optimization ideas. Take a look at it to see what's going on."
